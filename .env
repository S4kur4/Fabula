"Hello. I am Vivian Kent, a Senior Frontend Engineer by day and a visual explorer by weekend. Based in Sydney, Australia, I specialize in minimalist architectural photography and street portraits.",
"My work attempts to find the underlying grid systems in organic environments—a habit likely formed from years of debugging CSS layouts. I believe good photography, like clean code, should be invisible yet impactful."
